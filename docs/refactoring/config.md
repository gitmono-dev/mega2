# Configuration

`config/config.toml` is the canonical sample configuration. Validate a selected
base/profile/environment combination before starting a service:

```bash
cargo run -p monoengine -- --config config/config.toml config validate
```

Configuration source diagnostics are available with `--show-sources`; use
`--deny-warnings` in automation that must reject ignored or deprecated input.
Secrets are supplied by deployment configuration or supported Vault
`SecretRef`s and must never be committed.

## Website authentication and product email

Browser sessions are validated against website Better Auth. The `[oauth]`
section supplies the website API base URL, accepted session-cookie names, and
the CORS allow-list. The complete trust boundary is documented in
[`website-auth.md`](./website-auth.md).

Product-email delivery is delegated to the website. Monoengine configuration
contains the website email API base URL and bearer/SecretRef used by the
notification client; see [`website-mail.md`](./website-mail.md) for the
request contract and Compose values.

There is no `[mail]` section, `MailConfig`, `mail.password` SecretRef, or
`MEGA_MAIL__*` environment override. These removed inputs are rejected rather
than silently ignored.

## Notification settings

Notification configuration controls monoengine-owned delivery such as in-app,
Slack, and webhook notifications. The `email` preference requests delivery
through the website API; it does not configure a local mail provider. Refer to
[`notification.md`](./notification.md) for behavior and test boundaries.

## Test configuration

`.env.test.example` documents public test endpoints for PostgreSQL, Redis, and
RustFS. Its `MAILPIT_*` values are optional website-next SMTP-capture inputs;
monoengine neither reads them nor sends SMTP. The Compose topology and service
profiles are documented in [`test-infra.md`](./test-infra.md).
